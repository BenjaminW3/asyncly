# Asyncly Framework

This library implements task executors and higher level primitives built on
them.

## Documentation

Documentation can be generated by the following commands (requires docker):

cd Docs ./generate_docs.sh

You should then be able to open the docs at `modules/asyncly_docs/index.html`.
We are working on deploying those to a web server from CI.
